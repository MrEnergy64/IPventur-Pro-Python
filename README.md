# IPventur-Pro-Python for Linux

My first python 3 script try for IPventur-Pro console menu for nmap with scripts support.

For the time being, you just need Linux nmap (it scanning for fping as well, but not yet implemented)

1. install nmap (sudo apt-get install nmap, or sudo dnf install nmap, or etc.
2. download the IPventur.py (englisch version) and start it with python3 IPventur.py


actual it is a first beta (no fping included etc), but please let me know, what you wish in that script. I know the python script can be written much better (def function and so on), but it is working.
